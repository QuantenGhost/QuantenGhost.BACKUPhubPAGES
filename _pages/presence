# About - QuantenGhost Online Presence

## Web Sites
I am own QuantenGhost.com for the next decade at least.
I also utilize static GitPages at QuantenGhost.github.io for some content.

### Online Accounts
I have public-facing accounts for QuantentGhost on:
GitHub
Twitter
Keybase

### Idle Accounts
Once I had a unique username, QuantenGhost, I registered the name with most web services.
This was intended to prevent name domain-squatting, name usurping, or spoofing.
If you see QuantenGhost on a service without any user icon or avatar, it's safe to assume I won't post there.

## Limited Posting
I do post more under my real identity. However, I post as QuantenGhost some things that might be too techncial or potentially malicous for my normal audience.

## Contact
Contacting me is going to be relatively easier if you know me.
I do use Proton for private email in association with QuantentGhost@proton.com
However, I do not check this very frequently like I do with work and personal accounts.
Still feel free to drop me a line if you feel inclined to reach out.
