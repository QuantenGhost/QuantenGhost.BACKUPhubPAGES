## About the QuantenGhost Name

## Why a Persona
### Freedom From My Perfectionism
My professional image is painstacking to maintain. I want to drop the facade and just blurt mindless content into the world. This is the calling of every blogger. Do write without the burden of polish, I decided to adopt a super-hero-like secret identity. 

### Writing Without Audience Consideration
Honestly, I'm just likely to write more technically here than I would for my normal audience. I won't abuse this freedom so if I'm doxxed it won't be career limiting. Still, as I'm not crafting content for any particular audience I don't expect anything to be a pleasant read. Proceeed with caution.

## Why "QuantenGhost"
### Spooky Vibe
Some of my information security work has related to research into the "Dark Arts". With digitial forensic work that saw anit-forensic methods to cause advesary action to practically disappear, I had a appreciation for these ghosts in systems. If I were to brand myself, some element of spook-work made sense to convey.

### Quanten
Quanten, is a German pluarl for Quantum.
/ˈkvantən/

When contemplating spooky things, I recalled from my research into Quntumn entanglement that Albert Einstein famously dismissed quantum entanglement, the ability of separated obejects to share a condition or state, calling it spooky action "Spukhafte Fernwirkung" at a distance. (https://archive.org/details/TheBornEinsteinLetters/page/n89)

Having done some mild research in Quantum Key Distribution, I admire the entire Qunatum Computing feild.
When I was sent to Switerland, I was invited to a Computer Science lecture at ETH Zürich wich deepend my appreciation for German technologists and Einstein.

Quanten!

### Ghost
Ghost are Spukhafte
Ghost in the Shell 
Ghost in the Machine
Ghostbusters
Ghost are as spooky as it gets. Ghost are barely there. 
Ghosts are easily identified in iconography making logos simpler.

Yup Ghost was the English word in the multi-lingual username.

### Not German
While I can get by in a few languages, I definately don't speak fluent German.
Despite extensive global work, including occasionally living abroad for short projtects, I'm not great with languages.
With the mixed GuantenGhost, I will default to using my chosen moniker as though it were English. (How characteristic of English to reach into another language, grab a word they like, and borrow it for their language)

### QuantenGhost, Not QuantengHost
I sometimes favor cammel case for compoud words in URLs. QuantenGhost if lowercase (quantenghost) could be mistaken without understanding the invented meaning. I'm hoping to avoid QuantengHost. If systems do not respect uppercase characters, I've been occationally hypenating as quanten-host if clarity seems prudent.

### Unique Handle
There is a curse to decades of internet usage, many good screennames are already taken.
My first goal was to invent some name that wasn't registered with any service.


Finally, Quanten, a German word in an English username was uqinue enought to secure a unique username with a large number of services.

I've seemingly obtained that with QuantenGhost.
