I really appreciate that you are contemplating reaching out to me!

I am perpetually reachable, like so many constantly connected hardworking professionals. I am talkative and enjoy sharing information. I would be happy to hear from you. However, be advised that I prioritize my professional obligations and may be slower in response to QuantenGhost messages. 

Secure Email: QuantenGhost@protonmail.com
Email is convenient. I prefer Proton mail which supports encryption and privacy.

Twitter: @QuantenGhost
This is my primary means of broadcasting things to the world so please follow me there. I do read my DMs and allow them from people I don't follow, but would prefer email if you're reaching out from the blue about something. I don't see every mention so you may not get a reply via a public tweet.

LinkedIn: QuantenGhost
I have an account just to map a similar skillset to my actual experience. I do not connect with coworkers, but follow some distant industry leaders and post the rare interesting tidbits that aren’t relevant to my day work.

Signal
The signal messaging app is the closest to a secure messaging system that is widely available. However, you’ll need to know my phone number before we can exchange messages there. This is my prima

Keybase and public PGP key
I'm on Keybase.io with both my public key available and a bunch of identity proofs as well. If you absolutely must encrypt a message, use the key there.

What I'll definitely respond to
I'm happy to make comments to media on any breaking security stories, I usually like to talk.

Genuine queries about speaking at events will get a response, even if I can't accept the invite.

What I may not respond to
I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer you try asking on Stack Overflow first.

I probably won't respond to queries to check out your [insert awesome thing here] simply due to the volume of these requests I get.

If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response or it's vague or not clear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.

If you're looking for data in a data breach (yes, even your own), read why I won't be able to help you before emailing me asking for data!

What I won't respond to
No, you cannot guest-post on 

No, I will not promote your infographic for you.

No, I will not link to your [insert whatever you think is awesome here].

No, contacting me and asking "Can I ask you a question?" is already a question and won't result in me responding with "Yes, I don't know what your other question is but ask me anyway".

No, phrases like "I just wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox" and "maybe you didn't receive my earlier email" will not increase the likelihood of me responding - they guarantee you the opposite!
