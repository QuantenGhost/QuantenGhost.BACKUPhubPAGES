#About - QuantenGhost Avatar

## Who's In The Photos?
Never me. Just an masked image applied to the persona.

## Just a Cool Mask
While the artwork is all stock images, I was drawn to images of an LED mask I had seen online. I'm also hoping to avoid odd connotations or more radically worn masks like Guy Fawkes. I have no problem with those masks, but I don't want to be misunderstood as representing any group nor cause.

## Why a Mask
The mask is perhaps cliche, but the trope works in conjuction with freedom of speech.

## Stock Photos
As a white hat professional, I also respect intellectual property. At no point will I misuse someone elses intellectual work. Kind artists have provided stock images for personal blog use that do not require attribution in their image licensing.

## Shout Out To Sebastiaan Stam
Most of the masked images were staken by a photographer from the Netherlands, Sebastian Stam @Dutch_Photographer. While, I don't have a consistent scheme for optional and kind attribution of every image, I do want to acknowledge here how grateful I am for the graciously open license and excellent artistic work.

## Not the Purge
After settling my my admiration of the LED X-Mask stock photos, I saw that a movie used the mask. The Purge: Election Year landed on the same costume mask. However, I have't seen the movie nor do I wish to be associated with a murder-centric horror  movie franchise. I'll not mix the Lady Liberty character to keep my image and usage distinct from the film's.
