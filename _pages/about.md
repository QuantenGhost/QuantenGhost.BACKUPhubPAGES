## About QuantenGhost


### InfoSec Professional by Day
I am a very senrior Security Engineer for a very large company. 
I have certifications galore and advanced degrees relevant to Information Security.
I am strictly white hat. I'm sworn to several sets of professional ethics

### Infrastructure as Code
Many security professionals are drawn to the specialization from development of infrastructure roles.
I favor infrastructure, this now means modern infrastructure-as-code.
It used to be that applications could lie, the OS could lie, but the network held the truth.
Nothing is ever that simple, but in data centers the raw power called to me.
Now, that broad experience has formed a great understanding of modern clouds.

### Code, Not Programmer
After a decade of programming, I decided not to work as a full-time programmer. 
I got talked into it again and quickly made tons of cash before the startup tanked.
Thankfully, I was already comfortable in several languages when infrastructure-as-code became trendy.
Now, I'm a huge proponent of DevSecOps and infrastructure-as-code.

I also believe that every modern worker in any professiona should learn at least one object orriented language and one shell scripting language. So I do mentor and coach programmers.

### I Share Knowledge
Early in my career, brilliant technologists made the time to show me amazing work.
I don't ever forget those formative mentors who broadened and deepened my understanding.
Every chance I can, I will teach what I know. While I never want to be a teacher, I am a good trainer.
I've been brought in to train global engineering teams, scientists, developers and the like.
This accidentally initiated my side-hustle as Computer Science Faculty teaching Cyber Security and Network Engineering.

### Privacy Advocate
I believe in privacy. I stay clear of tin-foil-hat levels of concern. However, I personally desipse data breaches, data misuse, and under-informed consent to extreme privacy violations. Therefore I support respectful principals of encryption, open source liberties, and a basic right to privacy.

No one every has anything to hide. Part of an exercise I go through with executive teams involves asking them to imagine what a "zero-privacy world" seems like. Suddenly societal norms around compensation makes fully transparent earnings awkward. Even folks who have never spoken anything offensive realize that someone could more easily spoof their tursted communications. It's an undesired state, for even us law abiding citizens, to forgoe all privacy. Everyone will draw their line someone. I support having the tools available for exterting reasonable amounts of privacy.

As such, I'm an encryption junkie. Yes that includes cracking. I'm also lightly researching Quantumn Key Distribution networks.

### Command Line Interfaces
Every time I take my hand off a keyboard to touch a mouse, I've slowed my work.
Text commands changed less offten then icon locations.
Finally, commands in CLIs are almost always scriptable. 
Commands scale. It becomes trivial to control a thousand systems with a command, but clicking in a thousand GUIs would take days.

I believe that anyone who wishes to become a power-user of technology should attempt to modest learning curve in a terminal. 
Once you live the Command Line life, you'll immediately find uses for that new skill.

Having spend my life respecting command line interfaces, I now consider myself a CLI virtuoso.

### IT Strategy & Leadership
You can't be great at something without someone eventually deciding that you should be a manager.
This happens often in my career. Thankfully, one of my earlier degrees (after studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering) was from a Business school. What can I say, all that math got sexier with dollar-signs. So in addition to Finance, I learned a lot about business operations and management science. Coupled with some military leadership training and I was able to easily handle my earliest appointments into IT Management.

Since then, I have to work harder to keep my technical skills sharp. I haven't always taken management positions.
Some of the largest enterprises have sent fancy consultants to refine my management style, but honsest work with great teams has always been the best trainer.

It was in my first Master's program where IT Strategy was taught. While working for one enterprise, it was good to get a generalized exposure to how strategic leadership should function. My day-to-day can be very tactical as I lead by example. Stepping back and better understanding how to guide technical organizations was helpful. 

I expect that my continued promotions will lead me to a CISO position at some point.

### Personal Blog
QuantentGhost is just a personal pseudonym to isolate my musings and tinkering from my professional personal.
I have a few web presences as QuantentGhost if you find my content amusing or helpful.

I am using the QuantenGhost persona without direct association with my identity. My professional reputation is immaculate and privacy hardened. So I wanted an outlet where I could worry a bit less about polished presentation, obess about grammar, and mitigate some social engineering. Frogive me if you spot typos, things become out-of-date, or some posts remain incomplete.

## Social Media Presence
### Accounts
I have public-facing accounts for QuantentGhost on:
GitHub
Twitter
Keybase

### Limited Posting
I do post more under my real identity. However, I post as QuantenGhost some things that might be too techncial or potentially malicous for my normal audience.

### Contact

### Idle Accounts
Once I had a unique username, QuantenGhost, I registered the name with most web services.
This was intended to prevent name domain-squatting, name usurping, or spoofing.
If you see QuantenGhost on a service without any user icon or avatar, it's safe to assume I won't post there.


## Why a Persona
### Freedom From My Perfectionism
My professional image is painstacking to maintain. I want to drop the facade and just blurt mindless content into the world. This is the calling of every blogger. Do write without the burden of polish, I decided to adopt a super-hero-like secret identity. 

### Writing Without Audience Consideration
Honestly, I'm just likely to write more technically here than I would for my normal audience. I won't abuse this freedom so if I'm doxxed it won't be career limiting. Still, as I'm not crafting content for any particular audience I don't expect anything to be a pleasant read. Proceeed with caution.

## Why "QuantenGhost"
### Spooky Vibe
Some of my information security work has related to research into the "Dark Arts". With digitial forensic work that saw anit-forensic methods to cause advesary action to practically disappear, I had a appreciation for these ghosts in systems. If I were to brand myself, some element of spook-work made sense to convey.

### Quanten
Quanten, is a German pluarl for Quantum.
/ˈkvantən/

When contemplating spooky things, I recalled from my research into Quntumn entanglement that Albert Einstein famously dismissed quantum entanglement, the ability of separated obejects to share a condition or state, calling it spooky action "Spukhafte Fernwirkung" at a distance. (https://archive.org/details/TheBornEinsteinLetters/page/n89)

Having done some mild research in Quantum Key Distribution, I admire the entire Qunatum Computing feild.
When I was sent to Switerland, I was invited to a Computer Science lecture at ETH Zürich wich deepend my appreciation for German technologists and Einstein.

Quanten!

### Ghost
Ghost are Spukhafte
Ghost in the Shell 
Ghost in the Machine
Ghostbusters
Ghost are as spooky as it gets. Ghost are barely there. 
Ghosts are easily identified in iconography making logos simpler.

Yup Ghost was the English word in the multi-lingual username.

### Not German
While I can get by in a few languages, I definately don't speak fluent German.
Despite extensive global work, including occasionally living abroad for short projtects, I'm not great with languages.
With the mixed GuantenGhost, I will default to using my chosen moniker as though it were English. (How characteristic of English to reach into another language, grab a word they like, and borrow it for their language)

### QuantenGhost, Not QuantengHost
I sometimes favor cammel case for compoud words in URLs. QuantenGhost if lowercase (quantenghost) could be mistaken without understanding the invented meaning. I'm hoping to avoid QuantengHost. If systems do not respect uppercase characters, I've been occationally hypenating as quanten-host if clarity seems prudent.

### Unique Handle
There is a curse to decades of internet usage, many good screennames are already taken.
My first goal was to invent some name that wasn't registered with any service.


Finally, Quanten, a German word in an English username was uqinue enought to secure a unique username with a large number of services.

I've seemingly obtained that with QuantenGhost.



## How do I know it's you?
What a weird question to contemplate of a pseudonym. You're in luck though. As I am a fan of cryptography, I have some public signing keys published. If I choose to identify anything with reasonable idemnity I'll sign it.

## Who's In The Photos?
### Just a Cool Mask
I'm definately not pictured here, rather I was drawn to images of an LED mask I had seen online. I'm also hoping to avoid odd connotations or more radically worn masks like Guy Fawkes. I have no problem with those masks, but I don't want to be misunderstood as representing any group nor cause.
### Mask Centric Avatar
The mask is perhaps cliche, but the trope works in conjuction with freedom of speech.

### No Attribution Stock Photos
As a white hat professional, I also respect intellectual property. At no point will I misuse someone elses intellectual work. Kind artists have provided stock images for personal blog use that do not require attribution in their image licensing.
### Shout Out To Sebastiaan Stam
Most of the masked images were staken by a photographer from the Netherlands, Sebastian Stam @Dutch_Photographer. While, I don't have a consistent scheme for optional and kind attribution of every image, I do want to acknowledge here how grateful I am for the graciously open license and excellent artistic work.

### Not the Purge
After settling my my admiration of the LED X-Mask stock photos, I saw that a movie used the mask. The Purge: Election Year landed on the same costume mask. However, I have't seen the movie nor do I wish to be associated with a murder-centric horror  movie franchise. I'll not mix the Lady Liberty character to keep my image and usage distinct from the film's.
